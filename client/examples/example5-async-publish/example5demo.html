We're going to simulate a blog publishing application, publishing a user's text  to the web via an async publish.

Once published, the blog article will have a bit.ly `shortUrl` created for it, which we will embed in the document and republish. The `publishedUrl` and `shortUrl` will stay the same for all successive versions, but the `publishedRev` will be different.

We will simulate the actual publishing with methods that return promises, which resolve after a delay.
