  We've dealt with Promises as a client-side construct so far, but many npm libraries
  choose to return Promises instead of -or in addition to- accepting callbacks.

  If the library calls accept callbacks - you can use `Meteor.wrapAsync` to get a
  version that will appear to "await" the callback, and you're done. But until
  recently, if they returned a Promise, you were out of luck.

  However, with the new [`promise`](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/promise) package
  by MDG, `Promise.await` becomes the equivalent of `Meteor.wrapAsync`, but for
  functions returning promises. Nice :)

  <div>
    Let's call a method that will take some time on the server (2500 ms) to return:
  </div>
  <div>
    <button id="triggerPromise">Put the result of a server method awaiting a promise here-&gt;</button>
    <span id="promiseOutput">{{promiseVal}}</span>
  </div>
</template>
