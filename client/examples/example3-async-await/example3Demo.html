  We've shown using `ReactivePromise` to create a reactive helper function for a promise,
  but other times we simply want to do something with the value of the promise. If we're using
  `grigio:babel`, we can use experimental ES7 features called `async/await`, which let
  us "pause" execution until the promise has resolved. This is comparable to using a Fiber,
  however Fibers only run on the server, and once `async/await` is part of JavaScript,
  Fibers will only be an implementation detail few people will need to know about.
